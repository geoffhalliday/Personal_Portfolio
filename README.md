# Personal_Portfolio
A selection of Python files I have created.
I created the Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort programs to demonstrate how each sort works.
Football.py is inspired by the 1980s Football Manager computer game.  The user can edit names and ratings for defence, midfield and attack, and then watches the game play out.  To further develop the game, I intend to add input validation and create an option to play out a full leage.
Welsh.py is a simple language translation quiz.  I intend on developing this by adding the option to read Welsh/English terms from a data file, and creating another program to maintain the data file.
Decision_Trees.ipynb shows two tasks from the Data Science bootcamp, using decision trees and random forests.
