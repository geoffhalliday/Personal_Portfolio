# Personal_Portfolio
A selection of Python files I have created.
I created the Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort programs to demonstrate how each sort works.
Football.py is inspired by the 1980s Football Manager computer game.  The user selects teams for each team enters ratings for defence, midfield and attack, and then watches the game play out.  To further develop the game, I may make team and player names editable.
Welsh.py is a simple language translation quiz.  I intend on developing this by adding the option to read Welsh/English terms from a data file, and creating another program to maintain the data file.
